# Lab 2:  Find the square root of a number (Newtonâ€™s method)

[TOC]

## Problem statement 

Implement a python program that determines the square root of a number using the Newton's method. 

	Sample Input1: 25
	Sample Output1: 5
	
	Sample Input2: 9
	Sample Output2: 3
	
	Sample Input3: 20
	Sample Output3: 4.47213595


## Solution Key

```python 

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


def square_root(number):
    """returns the maximum number in the list
....The sequence of steps in the algorithm is:
....#1 - initialize the maximum value
....#2 - Loop through the entries in the list
........#3 - If maxval is not set, update with number
........#3 - If maxval is less than number, update
....#4 - Return the max value
...."""

	return number 


# Program starts here
number = input ("Input number: ") 
sqroot_number = square_root(number)
print ('The square root of ', number, 'is ', sqroot_number)


```
